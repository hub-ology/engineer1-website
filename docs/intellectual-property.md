# Intellectual Property

Engineers are constantly imagining new possibilities for systems.
Those ideas form designs that lead to real world implementations.
It's important for engineers to understand the legal protections that
exist for their intellectual property.   It's also important for engineers
to have an understanding of employer agreements that may impact their intellectual
property ownership for the things they create while working under that agreement.

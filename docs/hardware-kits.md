# Hardware Kits

![ENGINEER1 hardware kit package](/images/engineer1-hardware-kit.jpg)

We provide computer hardware kits to help encourage great problem solvers to do more with computing.
Priority will be given to folks without regular access to a computer but that is not a requirement to
receive a kit.

We currently include the [Raspberry Pi 400](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-400/) in the ENGINEER1 hardware kit along with other hardware that can be helpful when working on a project like the [solarshed](https://github.com/corbinbs/solarshed)

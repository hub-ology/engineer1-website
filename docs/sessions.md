# ENGINEER1 Sessions

ENGINEER1 sessions are live events that focus on one of the core ENGINEER1 Topics.
The goal for each session is to expose folks to engineering areas that will be important to 
advancing their career beyond learning to code.
Guest speakers are often involved in ENGINEER1 sessions to provide specific expertise on a topic area.
Whenever possible, we will provide session recordings for the benefit of folks unable to attend the
live events.

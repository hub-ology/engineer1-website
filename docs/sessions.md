# ENGINEER1 Sessions

ENGINEER1 sessions are live events that focus on one of the core ENGINEER1 Topics.
The goal for each session is to expose folks to information and wisdom that will be important to
advance their career.
Guest speakers are often involved in ENGINEER1 sessions to provide specific expertise on a topic area.
Whenever possible, we will provide session recordings for the benefit of folks unable to attend the
live events.  Sessions may also be completely virtual.

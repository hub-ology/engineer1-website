# Business and Finance

Great engineers have a keen appreciation for the financial impact of their engineering
decisions.  Old, boring solutions may be what's best for a given business.  Engineers
need to balance the push for the latest and greatest technology with other constraints
that may exist.   We shouldn't over engineer a solution that's really not necessary if 
we can find a solution that works better for a business.

engineers should also have a basic understanding of personal finance.  engineering jobs
are typically well paid and may offer other forms of compensation like stock options,
restricted stock units and other types of performance bonuses.  When evaluating an
employment opportunity, engineers should be well equipped to determine if the compensation
being provided is worth their time investment.

# Allyship

The best engineering teams include folks from all backgrounds.
These teams have members that support each other and encourage open debate.
There's a high level of trust.  It's impossible to provide truly world class products
and services without real allyship and highly diverse teams.
You cannot build a world class engineering team without ensuring that all team
members feel welcomed and feel safe.

ENGINEER1 focuses on putting real allyship first before anything else.

practical skills blended into meaningful lessons



engineer1.org
=============

Curriculum for (life) success as an entry level engineer or as the first engineer at a new company.
(Engineer 1 is a play on "Software Engineer I" a typical entry level position and the title folks gave me at 
 PokitDok - "Engineer 1" the first engineer/employee at the company.  Those are very different roles but the 
 core skills needed to be successful in each are the same.)

The curriculum and programs related to engineer1.org are based on things I felt like helped me succeed in the 
role of "Engineer 1" as well as things I wished I'd known prior to starting that adventure.

engineer1.org would be an official hub-ology project with all activities rolled up under the main non-profit.

Curriculum would include:

* communication skills: written, verbal and emojis (even more important in remote work)
* creative problem solving
* finance 
  - money management
  - investing, 
  - stock options/equity
* legal
  - breaking up fancy legalese into basic terms
  - copyright
  - software licenses
  - patents
* music (collaborate with https://www.codescty.com/)
* remote work (solving problems within different lessons with peers in other opportunity zones)
* science (https://github.com/corbinbs/solarshed is a core Python project to help understand alternative energy sources and environmental impact.  It also helps to have back up power when working remotely.)
* time management
* hardware and software (not just writing code)

The curriculum is open source and can be used/reused in any environment where it's appropriate.

engineer1 teaches folks solid software engineering skills without being all about "the code."  
The software development bits are blended into other lessons (balance your checkbook with Python, 
learn about compounding interest, lab measurements, music composition)
Help make learning fun and interesting for folks at risk of dropping out of school.
(... and maybe provide a path back for folks that already have?)

Rollout
-------

Identify different rural opportunity zone sites in SC (and maybe later across the South, the US, etc.)
and connect them via Slack (or equivalent tools - I met community manager from Slack at PyCon 2019)

Possible sites in SC based on :  https://ruralinnovation.us/rural-opportunity-map/

Cowpens or Gaffney
Loris
Yemassee or Beaufort

Three locations like those would roughly outline the state of SC.
Maybe add a spot in the middle of the  state if a slow ramp up of sites like these go well?

Folks that complete the engineer1 program are ideal candidates for apprenticeships, 
Lambda School ( https://lambdaschool.com/ ), or traditional Computer Science / Engineering programs 
at colleges and universities.
Even with significant financial aid, many folks from rural areas may elect to go directly into apprenticeships 
so that they can fast track themselves toward an income to help themselves and their families.

The engineer1 program would build a network to help get folks from the rural areas connected with hiring companies
for apprenticeships/paid internships or a pipeline to Lambda School/College.
(The original hub-ology vision included this rural network of folks but never really got going...until now)
Venture Capitalists could be further incentivized to help more of the opportunity zone areas as clusters of "engineer1"
participants emerge.

How best to weave engineer1.org programs into the opportunity zones?

Public libraries?
Community Centers?
Public Schools?  
Churches? (while hub-ology cannot promote religion or directly support religious organizations as a public charity, 
we absolutely can bring something like engineer1 to these locations -- because in many spots, the church is community
center)

Maybe all of the above (over time).
Schools may be the best spot to connect with more folks from middle school up but also may be more 
complex to navigate.  With "partner teachers", it might be easier to introduce programs into the schools.
Do we know any middle school/high school teachers in any of these opportunity zones?
Different parts of the engineer1 program could be mixed and matched to complement the current topics 
that are active in a given teacher's classroom.  Special instructors could help lead the sections 
remotely or in person.  engineer1 activities continually reinforce "remote work" concepts that are important
to develop for long term success for folks electing to remain in the rural areas. 

Grants or Funding Sources (in addition to current public contributions) that may be appropriate for 
engineer1.org activities?
